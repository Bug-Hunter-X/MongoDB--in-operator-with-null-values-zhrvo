# MongoDB $in Operator with Null Values
This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with arrays containing `null` values.

## Problem
When using the `$in` operator with an array that contains `null`, the query might not return the expected results. This behavior is unexpected for many developers. The query might return documents where the specified field is `null`, which is generally not the intended behavior.

## Solution
To avoid this problem, ensure that the array used with the `$in` operator does not contain `null` values. If `null` values are possible, consider using separate queries or alternative approaches to filter documents based on whether a field is `null` or has one of the specified values.
